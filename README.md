# Dependencies

This plugin depends on common POSIX utilities (awk, grep, sed, etc.), Bash, Git, and Go. If you have a Go toolchain installed and selected via asdf (asdf current golang), it will be used to retrieve and build protoc-gen-connect-go. Otherwise, asdf will be used to retrieve the latest Go version and that will be used for the build.

# Install

Plugin:

```shell
asdf plugin add protoc-gen-connect-go https://github.com/dylanrayboss/asdf-protoc-gen-connect-go.git
```

protoc-gen-connect-go:

```shell
# Show all installable versions
asdf list-all protoc-gen-connect-go

# Install specific version
asdf install protoc-gen-connect-go latest

# Set a version globally (on your ~/.tool-versions file)
asdf global protoc-gen-connect-go latest

# Now protoc-gen-connect-go commands are available
protoc-gen-connect-go --version
```

Check [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) readme for more instructions on how to
